## How to Contribute

* Search the code for `NotImplementedException` or the `extern` keyword

* Send out a pull request (if at any time, you're not sure how it works, I'm
  glad to help, email paul@github.com

## What *not* to do

* Copy *any* implementation code from ILSpyed binaries - interfaces / class
  definitions only! This usually isn't a problem for WinMD files, but if
  you're working on System.Runtime.WindowsRuntime, you will see implementation
  too.

* Send PRs that don't follow the coding style
